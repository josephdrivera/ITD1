Problem #1 – Discount Double-Check
In this problem, you will be prompting the user for the price of 2 items bought at a store and give them a discount based on their total.


Create an h1 header for this section. Remember you can use if you need a break on your page to help the overall look.

You are going to purchase (2) items from an online store.
If you spend $100 or more, you will get a 10% discount on your total purchase.
If you spend between $50 and $100, you will get a 5% discount on your total purchase.
If you spend less than $50, you will get no discount.

You should prompt the user for the values using the prompt command.

Final results must be in an HTML element.

If the user DOES get a discount make the background of the results Green.

If the user DOES NOT get a discount make the background of the results Yellow.

User Inputs:
Cost of First Item (in $)
Cost of Second Item (in $)
